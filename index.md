## Project Introduction


_**The style of texts also carries imformation.**_ 

OCR (optical character recognition) technology for converting images and scanned documents into text is fairly mature with a high accuracy. It is also widely accessible to the pubilic as being embedded in softwares such as Adobe Acrobat. However, the font information is not preserved during the process, meaning users need to reformat the document from the scratch. This is inconvenient and can possibly introduce human errors in editing. Thus, we propose to use both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to recognize and distinguish typefaces of characters in scanned documents.

## Proposed Method



## Anticipated Results

While computer generated images of characters in different typefaces (with noises and minor distortions) are used in the training phase, the final goal is to recognize or distinguish at least 3 typefaces from real-life images of characters taken from scanned documents.

- After unsupervised learning, we expect the program to be able to form clusters of scanned images of charaters based on the typefaces.

- After supervised learning, we expect the program to be able to give predictions of the typefaces of scanned images of charaters.

- High accuracies of both programs are expected. However, the accuracies of different letters are expected to be different as some letters are distinct among typefaces than others.
