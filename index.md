## Project Introduction
**The style of texts also carries imformation.** OCR (optical character recognition) technology for converting images and scanned documents into text is fairly mature with a high accuracy. It is also widely accessible to the pubilic as being embedded in softwares such as Adobe Acrobat. However, the font information is not preserved during the process, meaning users need to reformat the document from the scratch. This is inconvenient and can possibly introduce human errors in editing. Thus, we propose to use both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to recognize and distinguish typefaces of characters in scanned documents.

### Next Steps

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisgrizzly/test/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chrisgrizzly/test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
